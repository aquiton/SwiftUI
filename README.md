# SwiftUI
App Development Journey

This is my SwiftUI Journey where I will be learning about the fundamentals of Swift
by creating mini projects which will teach me concepts and foundational functions of SwiftUI

Lesson Projects:
- Weather App
- Apple Framework
- QR Code Scanner
- Grocery Buyer

Projects After Learning(in progress):
- Task Scheduler/Presenter -> Formatted like the weather app
